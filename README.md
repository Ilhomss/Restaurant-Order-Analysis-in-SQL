🍽️ Restaurant Order Analysis – SQL Portfolio Project
📌 About the Project
This project is a data-driven analysis of a restaurant’s order data using SQL. Inspired by a Maven Analytics portfolio challenge, it focuses on uncovering insights into customer ordering behavior, popular menu items, and operational performance. The entire project was completed using MySQL and structured for clarity, accuracy, and real-world applicability.

🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis using SQL. It also serves as a strong portfolio piece for aspiring business or data analyst roles. The project showcases how to clean, query, and extract actionable insights from real-world data.
