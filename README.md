# 🍽️ Restaurant Order Analysis – SQL Portfolio Project

## 📌 About the Project
This project is a data-driven analysis of a restaurant’s order data using SQL. Inspired by a Maven Analytics portfolio challenge, it focuses on uncovering insights into customer ordering behavior, popular menu items, and operational performance. The entire project was completed using **MySQL** and structured for clarity, accuracy, and real-world applicability.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis using SQL. It also serves as a strong portfolio piece for aspiring business or data analyst roles. The project showcases how to clean, query, and extract actionable insights from real-world data.

## 🧩 Problem & Solution
### Problem:
Restaurants often struggle to understand which items are performing well, how customers place orders, and how to optimize operations based on order patterns.

### Solution:
This project analyzes order-level data to:

- ✅ Identify top-performing items  
- 📈 Spot trends in order volume and size  
- 🔍 Find large or complex orders that may need operational adjustments  

Through SQL queries, these insights can help streamline kitchen efficiency, improve inventory planning, and enhance customer service.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Rationale
- **MySQL**: Chosen for its wide usage in the industry, ease of setup, and powerful querying capabilities.  
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.  
- **Maven Analytics Dataset**: A realistic dataset that simulates typical restaurant order data, perfect for demonstrating business-relevant skills.

## ✅ Metrics of Success
- Used MySQL to dig into over 1,000 restaurant orders.
- Analyzed a dataset of restaurant orders and categorized food preferences across 4 cuisines
- Found that **Italian and Mexican** dishes were most popular, each with 9 different dishes ordered
- Discovered **Chicken Tacos** as the most ordered dish overall; **Hamburgers** were the least ordered — guiding menu optimization
- Other metrics such as **overall number of orders**, **Average price of foods by Country**, **the least and most expansive couisine** and others
